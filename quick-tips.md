# 📌 Quick Coding Tips

#### 1. 🔁 Replace a Word in Multiple Files (VS Code)
Use VS Code’s global search to quickly replace a word or variable across your entire codebase:
```
Ctrl + Shift + H  (or Cmd + Shift + H on Mac)
```
Type the word you want to replace, and its replacement — then hit **Replace All**.

#### 2. 📂 Open a Project Folder in Terminal
Navigate to your project’s folder and run:
```bash
code .
```
> ✅ Requires VS Code to be added to your PATH.

#### 3. 🧪 Create a Virtual Environment in Python
Keep your Python project dependencies isolated:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 4. 📷 Preview a Jupyter Notebook Without Running It
Quickly view `.ipynb` files on GitHub or convert to HTML:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb
```
